# Rust client SDK for SPL System

An autogenerated Rust client SDK for the System program.

## Getting started

From your project folder:

```bash
cargo add spl-system
```

## Structure

The client SDK is divided into several modules:

- `accounts`: structs representing the accounts of the program
- `errors`: enums representing the program errors
- `instructions`: structs to facilitate the creation of instructions, instruction arguments and CPI instructions
- `types`: structs representing types used by the program
